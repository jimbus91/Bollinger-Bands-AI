This script is using the yfinance library to download historical stock data for a specified ticker symbol, using the 'start' parameter to specify a start date of '2022-01-23'. The script then converts the date column to a datetime object, sets it as the index, and sorts the data by date. It then takes a copy of the last 365 days of data, and calculates the moving average, upper and lower Bollinger Bands of the close prices.
It then splits the data into features (moving average, upper and lower Bollinger Bands) and target (close prices), and fits an HistGradientBoostingRegressor model to the data. The script then makes predictions for the next 30 days using the last data point of moving average, upper and lower Bollinger Bands. The script also adds some random values to the predicted prices, and concatenates the last year's data and the predictions dataframe. Finally, the script plots the predicted close prices for the next 30 days with Bollinger Bands.
